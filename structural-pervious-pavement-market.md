<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Structural Pervious Pavement Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pervious Concrete</li><li>Porous Asphalt</li><li>Interlocking Concrete Pavers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The structural pervious pavement market encompasses three primary types: pervious concrete, porous asphalt, and interlocking concrete pavers. Pervious concrete features interconnected voids, allowing water to flow through while maintaining structural integrity, making it ideal for low-traffic areas. Porous asphalt uses a similar approach but incorporates a bitumen mixture that supports heavier loads. Interlocking concrete pavers consist of individual units that create gaps for water infiltration, combining durability with aesthetic flexibility, suitable for both pedestrian and vehicular applications.</p></p>
