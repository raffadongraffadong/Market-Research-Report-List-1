<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The FGD Lining Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Vulcanized Lining</li><li>Cold Vulcanized Lining</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The FGD (Flue Gas Desulfurization) lining market is primarily divided into two types: hot vulcanized lining and cold vulcanized lining. Hot vulcanized lining involves the application of heat and pressure to bond rubber linings to substrates, ensuring a strong, durable seal suitable for high-temperature environments. Conversely, cold vulcanized lining uses adhesives and cures at room temperature, offering ease of application and flexibility but potentially lower durability under extreme conditions. Both options cater to different operational requirements in industrial settings.</p></p>
