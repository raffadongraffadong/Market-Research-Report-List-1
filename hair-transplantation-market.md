<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hair Transplantation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT)</li><li>Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hair transplantation market primarily consists of two types: Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) and Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE). FUT involves removing a strip of scalp from the donor area, which is then dissected into individual follicular units for transplantation. This method can yield a larger number of grafts in one session but may result in a linear scar. Conversely, FUE extracts individual follicular units directly from the scalp using a punch tool, leaving minimal scarring and allowing for quicker recovery.</p></p>
